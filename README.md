# String Calculator

The String Calculator is a simple Ruby class that can add a string of comma-separated numbers.

## Features

- The `add` method takes a string of comma-separated numbers and returns their sum.
- An empty string returns 0.
- The method can handle an unknown amount of numbers.
- The method can handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
- The method supports different delimiters. To change the delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: "//[delimiter]\n[numbersâ€¦]".
- Calling `add` with a negative number will throw an exception "negative numbers not allowed <negative_number>". If there are multiple negative numbers, all of them are shown in the exception message, separated by commas.

## Usage

```ruby
calculator = StringCalculator.new
calculator.add('1,2,3') # returns 6
calculator.add('//;\n1;2') # returns 3
calculator.add('1,-2,3,-4') # raises RuntimeError, "negative numbers not allowed: -2, -4"
